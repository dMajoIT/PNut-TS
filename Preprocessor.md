## PNut-TS Preprocessor Command line options

A couple of command line options affect the preprocessing:

| Option | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| <PRE>-D \<symbolName></PRE> | Defines a symbol that can be tested with the `#ifdef`, `#ifndef`,  `#elseifdef` or `#elseifndef` statements. Equivalent to `#define SYMBOL` but affects all files in the compilation effort. |
| <PRE>-U \<symbolName></PRE>  | The -U option can undefine a symbol that was previously defined by using the -D option. <Br>**NOTE:** *The -U option can not undefine a symbol created by a #define directive.*
| <PRE>-I \<directory></PRE>  | Specify the folder to search within for files specified using `#include "filename(.spin2)"` statements, or as `files mentioned in the OBJ or DAT sections of your code`
| -- **Diagnostic Use** -- |
| <PRE>-i, --intermediate | Generate `*__pre.spin2` file after preprocessing - so you can review what preprocessed source was fed to the compiler

**NOTE:** The above directives apply to all .spin2 files processed in the compile effort, not just the top-level file.  This means that the compilation of all #included files and all files specified in the OBJ block of each object will be affected by these -D and -U options.

## Preprocessor Directives

PNut-TS has a pre-processor that understands a few primitive directives:

- `#define`
- `#undef`
- `#ifdef / #ifndef / #else / #endif`
- `#elseifdef / #elseifndef`
- `#error / #warn`
- `#include`
- `#pragma`

Here's more detail on each of the supported directives

If you see the similarity to the FlexSpin directive set, you are correct! This capability was patterned after the directives supported by FlexSpin so that there will be fewer compatibility issues when utilizing spin2 code with either compiler.

### Directives

#### \#define {symbol} {value}

```c++
#define FOO hello
```

Defines a new symbol `FOO` with the value `hello`. Whenever the symbol `FOO` appears in the text, the preprocessor will substitute `hello`.

Note that, unlike the traditional preprocessors, **this preprocessor** does not accept arguments. Only simple defines are permitted.

Also note that this preprocessor is case insensitive, just like spin.

If no value is given, e.g.:

```c++
#define BAR
```

then the symbol `BAR` is defined as the string `1`. This is generally useful when symbol presence is being used, not the value. That is to say that the symbol is being tested by following preprocessor directives and is not expected to be replacing text within the containing file.

#### \#ifdef {symbol}

Introduces a conditional compilation section, which is only compiled if the symbol after the `#ifdef` is in fact defined. For example:

```c++
#ifdef __P2__
'' propeller 2 code goes here
#else
'' propeller 1 code goes here
#endif
```

#### \#ifndef {symbol}

Introduces a conditional compilation section, which is only compiled if the symbol after the `#ifndef` is _not_ defined.

```c++
#ifndef __P2__
'' propeller 1 code goes here
#else
'' propeller 2 code goes here
#endif
```

*Pardon this non-traditional example, but you get the point, right?*

#### \#else

Switches the meaning of conditional compilation. Must be preceded by a `#ifdef` or a `#ifndef`.

#### \#endif

Ends the conditional compilation `#ifdef` or `#ifndef` clause.

#### \#elseifdef {symbol}

A combination of `#else` and `#ifdef`. Must be preceded by a `#ifdef` or a `#ifndef`.

#### \#elseifndef {symbol}

A combination of `#else` and `#ifndef`. Must be preceded by a `#ifdef` or a `#ifndef`.

#### \#error {msg}

Prints an error message. Mainly used in conditional compilation to report an unhandled condition. Everything after the `#error` directive is printed. Example:

```c++
#ifndef __P2__
#error This code only works on Propeller 2
#endif
```

#### \#include "{filename}"

Includes a file. The contents of the file are placed in the compilation just as if everything in that file was typed into the original file instead.

```c++
#include "foo.spin2"
#include "bar"
```

Included files are searched for in the same directory as the file that contains the `#include`. Or, alternatively, in an include directory provided by the compilation `-I <dir>` clause on the command line. If one or more include directories are specified, then they will be searched first.

NOTE: if the .spin2 suffix is not present on the filename provide in the include statement it will be appended to the name given before opening the file.  Meaning all included files will only be .spin2 files.  If any suffix is provided that is not .spin2 this will generate an error and stop the compile.

#### \#warn {msg}

`#warn` prints a warning message; otherwise it is similar to `#error`.

#### \#undef {symbol}

Removes a prior definition of a symbol, e.g., to undefine `FOO` do:

```c++
#undef FOO
```

Removes the user-defined symbol FOO if it was defined.

Note that #undef will not do anything if one of our built-in symbols was named.

### \#pragma statements

**Background: \#pragma** is a preprocessor directive that provides a way to give additional instructions to the compiler. It's used for compiler-specific or operating-system-specific actions, allowing control over compilation behavior beyond what's available in the standard language. Pragmas are implementation-defined, meaning their effects can vary between compilers.

The following \#pragma(s) are supported in PNut_TS:

#### \#pragma exportdef {SYMNAME}

The `exportdef` \#pragma exports the definition of the macro `SYMNAME` to other files. Normally a preprocessor macro only takes effect in the single source file in which it was defined. `#pragma exportdef` applied to the macro causes it to be exported to the global namespace, so that it will be in effect in all subsequent files, including objects.

Note that macros exported to other files by `#pragma exportdef` have lower priority than macros defined on the command line, that is, `#pragma exportdef SYMNAME ` has lower priority than `-DSYMNAME`. 

Example of `#pragma exportdef ...` use:

Top level file main.spin2:

```
#define MEMDRIVER "driver2.spin2"
#pragma exportdef MEMDRIVER

' instantiate flash.spin2 with the
' default memory driver overridden by
' MEMDRIVER

OBJ flash : "flash.spin2"
```

Subobject obj.spin2:

```
#ifndef MEMDRIVER
#define MEMDRIVER "default_driver"
#endif

OBJ driver : MEMDRIVER
```

**Note** that if there are multiple uses of `#pragma exportdef` for the same symbol, only the first one will actually be used -- that is, a macro may be exported from a file only once. 

Similarly if SYMBOL was defined on the command line (`-DSYMBOL`), then a `#pragma exportdef SYMBOL` will not have any effect.

## Predefined Symbols

There are several predefined symbols:


| Symbol             | When Defined                                                            |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `__propeller__`    | defined as 2 (for Propeller 2)
| `__P2__`           | defined as 1 (compiling for Propeller 2)
| `__propeller2__`   | defined as 1 (compiling for Propeller 2)
| `__PNUTTS__`       | defined as 1, indicating that the `PNut-TS` compiler is used
| `__DATE__`         | a string containing the date when compilation was begun
| `__FILE__`         | a string giving the current file being compiled
| `__TIME__`         | a string containing the time when compilation was begun
| `__VERSION__`      | a string containing the full version of PNut-TS in use (e.g., 'v1.43.0')
| `__DEBUG__`        | defined as 1 only if compiling debug() statements is enabled (-d given)
