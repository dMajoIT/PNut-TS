# PNut-TS Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the PNut-TS SPIN2/PASM2 compiler.

## üìÅ Directory Structure

### `/internals/` - Current System Documentation
Documents that explain how the existing compiler works:

- **[SPIN2-BIN-Format.md](internals/SPIN2-BIN-Format.md)** - Complete specification of the .bin file format and object organization
- **[Theory-of-Operations.md](internals/Theory-of-Operations.md)** - Comprehensive compilation flow from source files to binary output
- **[Distiller-Theory-of-Operations.md](internals/Distiller-Theory-of-Operations.md)** - How the object distillation mechanism works

### `/language-specification/` - PASM2/SPIN2 Language Specification Package
Complete language specification and IDE integration package for Parallax Propeller 2 development:

- **[README.md](language-specification/README.md)** - Complete language specification package overview
- **234 total language elements** extracted from PNut-TS compiler source
- **IDE integration files** for VS Code, Sublime, Atom, Vim, Emacs
